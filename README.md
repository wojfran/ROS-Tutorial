# ROS-Tutorial
The results of following this ROS tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfDJAYTMTdk&amp;t=1622s&amp;ab_channel=RoboticsBack-End

The goal of the tutorial is to familiarize myself with nodes, topics, publishers, subscribers, services and messages. The content of the tutorial focuses on creating nodes interacting with the ROS built in package of turtlesim.

As the nodes created in this tutorial operate on the turtlesim package, they won't have much effect if the turtlesim_mode node won't be run. To do this, create a rosmaster and then enter the command 'rosrun turtlesim turtlesim_mode'. After that one can use all of the created nodes effectively.
